# RNA-seq Analysis: Batch Effect Correction and DESeq2

This repository contains an RNA-seq analysis pipeline focused on:
- Gene annotation (Ensembl GTF)
- Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for batch effect detection
- Batch correction with **ComBat-seq**
- Differential expression analysis with **DESeq2**
- Visualization (heatmaps, violin plots)
- Coding vs non-coding gene relationships
